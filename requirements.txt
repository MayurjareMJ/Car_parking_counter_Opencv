"""1..Import Libraries: The code begins by importing necessary libraries including OpenCV (cv2), PyTorch (torch), and NumPy (numpy).

2..points: An empty list used to store points obtained from mouse events.

3...POINTS function: This function is called whenever a mouse event occurs on the window named 'FRAME'. It prints the coordinates of the mouse pointer when it moves.
Set up Mouse Callback: It creates a window named 'FRAME' and sets the mouse callback function to POINTS for this window.

4..Load YOLOv5 Model: The YOLOv5 model is loaded using the torch.hub.load() function from the ultralytics/yolov5 repository. The model used here is YOLOv5s, which is a smaller version of the YOLOv5 model.

5..Open Video Capture: It opens a video file named 'parking.mp4' using cv2.VideoCapture().

6..Define Parking Area: An array named area is defined containing coordinates of points that define the parking area polygon.

7..Object Detection and Tracking Loop:The loop iterates through each frame of the video.

8..Resizes the frame to a size of (1020, 600).
9..Passes the frame through the YOLOv5 model for object detection using model(frame).
10..Iterates over the detected objects and draws bounding boxes around them on the frame.
11..Calculates the centroid of each detected car bounding box and checks if it lies within the defined parking area polygon.
12..If a car's centroid lies within the parking area, it counts as a parked car.
13..Draws the parking area polygon on the frame.
14..Displays the count of parked cars on the frame.
15..Waits for a key press to exit the loop.
16..Display Frame and Handle User Events: It displays the frame with detected objects and waits for a key press. If the key pressed is ESC (key code 27), it breaks out of the loop.

Release Resources: After the loop ends, it releases the video capture and closes all OpenCV windows."""
